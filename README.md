# Kindle-Sentiment Analysis
The Amazon Kindle dataset we choose had different users who have given ratings to the product along with reviews for these. We are supposed to find the rating of these products/books using the reviews or the summary. We have done this prediction using sentiment analysis with the use of methods like Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier:
Where we converted our ratings to Positive(4,5) or Negative(1,2,3), where we got accuracy of 85.3%.
Where we converted the rating to Positive(4,5),  Negative(1,2) or Neutral(3) where we got accuracy of 74.3%.
Where the rating were like they were provided (1-5), here we got the Accuracy of 63%. With better Specifications and better GPU and CPU this accuracy can be further improved by further tuning the model.
